# GlobalBestTest
#R Codes for a function to perform the Global Best Significance tests after the BIOENV procedure in multivariate analyses
#For my PhD thesis (https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/82744/1/2021UdochiSPhD.pdf), I needed to perform the Global Best Significance Test linked to the BIOENV procedure and 
#found out that this was not possible in any open source programme - only in the paid PRIMER package. I therefore wrote these codes, which I'm now adding here should this be 
#beneficial to anyone out there.
#Enjoy!
